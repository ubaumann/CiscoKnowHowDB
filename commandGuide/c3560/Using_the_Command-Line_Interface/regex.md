# Regex Metacharacters

- **Character**
  - Description
  - Notes
- **.**
  - Dot
  - Matches any single character. For example, **d.g** matches **dog**, **dag**, **dtg**, and any word that contains those characters, such as doggonnit.
- **(exp)**
  - Subexpression
  - A subexpression segregates characters from surrounding characters, so that you can use other metacharacters on the subexpression. For example, **d(o|a)g** matches **dog** and **dag**, but **do|ag** matches **do** and **ag**. A subexpression can also be used with repeat quantifiers to differentiate the characters meant for repetition. For example, **ab(xy){3}z** matches **abxyxyxyz**.
- **|**
  - Alternation
  - Matches either expression it separates. For example, **dog|cat** matches **dog** or **cat**.
- **?**
  - Question mark
  - A quantifier that indicates that there are 0 or 1 of the previous expression. For example, **lo?se** matches **lse** or **lose**.
  - Note You must enter **Ctrl+V** and then the question mark or else the help function is invoked.
- ** * **
  - Asterisk
  - A quantifier that indicates that there are 0, 1 or any number of the previous expression. For example, **lo*se** matches **lse**, **lose**, **loose**, and so on.
- **+**
  - Plus
  - A quantifier that indicates that there is at least 1 of the previous expression. For example, **lo+se** matches **lose** and **loose**, but not lse.
- **{x} or {x,}**
  - Minimum repeat quantifier
  - Repeat at least x times. For example, **ab(xy){2,}z** matches **abxyxyz**, **abxyxyxyz**, and so on.
- **[abc]**
  - Character class
  - Matches any character in the brackets. For example, **[abc]** matches **a**, **b**, or **c**.
- **[^abc]**
  - Negated character class
  - Matches a single character that is **not** contained within the brackets. For example, **[^abc]** matches any character other than a, b, or c. **[^A-Z]** matches any single character that is not an uppercase letter.
- **[a-c]**
  - Character range class
  - Matches any character in the range. **[a-z]** matches any lowercase letter. You can mix characters and ranges: **[abcq-z]** matches **a, b, c, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z,** and so does [a-cq-z].
  - The dash (**-**) character is literal only if it is the last or the first character within the brackets: [abc**-**] or [**-**abc].
- **""**
  - Quotation marks
  - Preserves trailing or leading spaces in the string. For example, **" test"** preserves the leading space when it looks for a match.
- **^**
  - Caret
  - Specifies the beginning of a line.
- **\**
  - Escape character
  - When used with a metacharacter, matches a literal character. For example, **\[** matches the left square bracket.
